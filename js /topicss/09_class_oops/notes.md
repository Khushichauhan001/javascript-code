## object 
 - collection of properties and methods
 - toLowerCase , promises , etc are also objects

 ## why use oops

 ## parts of oop
   object literal <!--in oop.js in detail -->

 - constructor function
 - prototypes

 encapsulation :- basically wrap up the function
 inheritance :- 
 polymorphism :- single method of doing many works
